# Netflix Sound File Setup

The app now automatically plays the Netflix "ta-dum" sound effect on startup.

## To add the sound file:

1. Download a Netflix "ta-dum" sound effect (search for "Netflix intro sound" or "Netflix ta-dum sound")
2. Convert it to MP3 format if needed
3. Name it exactly `netflix-sound.mp3`
4. Place it in this `public` folder: `public/netflix-sound.mp3`

## Fallback:
If the sound file is not found, the app will automatically try to play a fallback beep sound.

## Sound will play automatically:
- No user interaction required
- Plays immediately when the splash screen loads
- Volume is set to 70% for optimal experience

## Free sound sources:
- Freesound.org
- YouTube Audio Library
- Search for "Netflix intro sound effect free"

The sound should be about 2-3 seconds long to match the animation timing.
